# electronic-signal

Create signals for TPC-based scattering experiments 

This project contains a tool to create a spectrum of the electronic signal for the 
Flash ADC used with TPC (ACTAF's parameters are used as a default). 
The code is tested with CERN ROOT v6.22. Run it using command:
```bash
root -b Run.C+
```

It also saves a map into **CHARGE_MapR.txt**.

To watch figures on a remote machine I use simple Python3 web-server
```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

**Important:** so far the calculation for electrons, which are close-to-anode
(**low h**) are wrong, due to granularity problem. This problem can be 
walk-arounded with **step_size=0.01 mm**. Small irregularity still exists! 
It's visible on a current graph, but it's smal wrt. to all current values.


## Dependencies

  * [CERN ROOT](https://root.cern.ch/)

## How it works
 1. Define TPC, readout and generator configurations in `Parameters.h`
 2. Define pad numbering function `get_pad_number()`
 3. Create a map of induced charge on rings with **step_size** width.
  Electron is mowing perpendicular to anode at **r=0**.
 4. Calculate induced charge and current with defined anode
  structure for an electron in point **(x,y)** using an overlap
  of the map and anodes.
 5. Find, which of anode is fired, using largest integral of current.
 6. Rescale currents for each of anodes with a common factor, which
  is evaluated to set current integral for the fired anode to unity.
